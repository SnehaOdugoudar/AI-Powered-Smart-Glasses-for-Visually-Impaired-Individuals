YOLOv5 Nano - Real-Time Object Detection

Description

This project implements real-time object detection using YOLOv5 Nano on a video stream (webcam or video file). It is optimized for edge devices like Raspberry Pi and low-power hardware. The system captures video frames, processes them using YOLOv5 Nano, and displays the detected objects.

Features

✅ Lightweight and fast object detection
✅ Works with live video or pre-recorded video files
✅ Optimized for Raspberry Pi and embedded devices
✅ Uses Torch, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLOv5
